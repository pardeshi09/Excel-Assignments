 Assignment 1 : Convert to Date Format (Convert-to-Date-Format.xlsx)
This time, you have been given a file containing Text dates into various formats. The challenge before you is to write a single formula to convert them into an appropriate date format.

Solution:

DATE function requires 3 arguments DAY, MONTH, YEAR and each of these has to be a number rather than text.
The month, year and date is the same in all cells. Month = January = 1; Year = 2017 and Day = 2nd
The single formula to convert them into an appropriate date format is 
=DATE(2017,01,02)
